# Introduction
Welcome to The Sparsey Book, a guide to the Sparsey Entity Component Sysem (ECS).

## Setting up
Before you start, make sure you have the latest stable Rust version installed by running:

```bash
rustup update stable
```

Also, you should add `Sparsey` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
sparsey = "0.6"
```
